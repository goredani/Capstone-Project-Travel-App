Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program Capstone Project:

Travel App

The Travel App is a simple app which uses 3 user inputs (location, arrival and leave dates) and 3 external API-s (Geonames, Weatherbit and pixaBay)
to generate an info box about the future travel.

The app will display the proper name of the city, the expected weather in Celcius, the time of the arrival and the leave date, 
the remaining days until the travel and the days which we will spend at the destination. The app also adds a related image from pixaBay.
